It looks like we're up to 22 survey responses which is awesome, thanks again to everyone who did that! I'm going to go through all of the new responses and then go from there.

On a different note, if you haven't signed up for the [email list](http://eepurl.com/iNDmuU) please consider doing so! I've been thinking about the 20 year and beyond reunions and who knows where Facebook will be. I figure if I can start to get a longer term contact solution in place (like email list w/ independent website) then it might future proof things a bit. If you have other ideas let me know, too!
